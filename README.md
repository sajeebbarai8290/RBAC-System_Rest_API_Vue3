# RBAC-System_Rest_API_Vue3
A Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System using Laravel for the backend and Vue 3 for the front end.
Backend (Laravel)

1. User Authentication  
   Implemented a full-featured authentication system using Laravel's built-in authentication features.
   Used Laravel Sanctum to implement token-based API authentication.
   Ensured that users can register, log in, and log out securely.

2. Role Management
    Created three distinct roles: `Admin`, `Manager`, and `User`.
    Admin users have full control over user management (creating, updating, deleting users, and assigning roles).
    Managers have limited control (e.g., managing users but no access to certain admin features).
    Regular users only have access to their own information.

3. Permissions System
    Implemented a system to assign specific permissions to roles when created role.
    For example, `Admin` can perform all actions, `Manager` can create/edit users but cannot delete, and `User` can only view their own profile.
    Ensured that permissions can be dynamically assigned and revoked by the Admin.

4. RESTful API
    Developed a RESTful API to manage users, roles, and permissions.
    API support the following operations:
    Create, update, delete, and fetch users.
     Assign roles and permissions to users.
     CRUD operations for roles and permissions.
     Protected the API routes using middleware to ensure that only authorized users can access certain routes.

5. Database Design
    Used MySQL for the database.
    Implemented proper relationships between users, roles, and permissions.
    Used migrations to set up database tables.
    Seed the database with sample data for testing (e.g., create default roles and permissions).

6. Validation & Error Handling
    Implemented server-side validation for all input data (e.g., user registration, role assignments).
    Provided meaningful error messages for both API and UI consumption.
    Handle edge cases gracefully (e.g., trying to delete a user currently assigned as an admin).

Frontend (Vue)

1. Admin Dashboard
    Created a user-friendly Admin Dashboard where the admin can:
     View all users and their assigned roles.
     Create, update, and delete users.
     Assign and revoke roles/permissions to/from users.

2. User Dashboard
    Created a basic User Dashboard that displays the user's profile information.
    Implemented role-based rendering, meaning regular users should only see limited information compared to admins.
    Ensured that the UI dynamically adapts based on the userâ€™s role and permissions.

3. Form Validation
    Implemented client-side form validation.
    Ensured consistency between client-side and server-side validation rules.
